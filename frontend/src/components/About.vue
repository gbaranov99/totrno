				<h1 class="headline">As the landing page suggests, the primary function of Totrno is to combine the functionality of todos, time-tracking, and notes into one consolidated experience.</h1>
				<br>
				<h1 class="headline">Totrno can be molded into whatever you need it to be, from the layout of files to the customizable settings.</h1>
				<br>
				<h1 class="headline">In Totrno, there are no folders, and no text documents. Totrno files have both areas for text, and have sub-files for organization.</h1>
				<br>
				<h1 class="headline">Although this format may seem odd initially, it allows for every user to customize their file structure the way they want. Users can get as specific as they want for each task, and can sub-file everything infinitely!</h1>
				<br>
				<h1 class="headline">Every file can have a due date or a time range associated with it, which can be viewed on the calendar app. Files can also be marked as completeable or as uncompleteable</h1>
				<br>
				<h1 class="headline">This format also allows for easy time tracking, with data stored for how much time was tracked for each file.</h1>
