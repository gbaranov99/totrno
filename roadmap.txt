Totrno is becoming more and more of a reality, so I think it is as good a time as any to plan out my next steps

What I have so far:
	Token user authentication
	A simple file api
	A simple front end with a basic description

What I want to get:
	Production set up
		Making sure website actually runs in production
		Storing user data between file upgrades
			(Do I need to have all of my backend set before I can do that?)
			How do db migrates work?
		Forwarding from gbaranov to totrno contact page

	Frontend	
		Pressing enter switches from username to password to submitting form
		Handling failed user requests, mostly login and registration
		Router forwarding depending on user login state
		Displaying the heirarchy of files and time logs associated
			Files being deleted when user presses the button
		Displaying user time tracked data: analytics
		A much better and more interactive landing page
		A better description and contact page
		A better interface for account information
			Including password changes, resets
		User interface for search
		User interface for calendar / dates
		Side nav menu that shows top 5 Root, Recent and Popular directories

	Backend
		A hierarchical file system
		Time logs attached to the file system
		JWT user authentication
		User email authentication
		Checks to manage user input size and number of requests
		Make requests not show the file number
			Have each user have their own file number
			At some point, create tables for each user (?)

	Sending out the app into the real world
		Post it on subreddits or hackernews
	
	Full device compatability
		Make the app usable on both a desktop brower and on a phone browser
		Enable phone notifications and maybe location data

I hope I can finish most of this stuff by december, although I may need until january
But by the start of next semester, if I don't have a product I am happy with, 
I put up what I have and begin in earnest searching for a real internship / real experience
Or begin a new project that I feel is more interesting
