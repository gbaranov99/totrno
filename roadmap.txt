Version 2 changes (completed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile layout plan:
	Top left has a button to open up the left side nav menu
	Left hand list is full width and length
	Clicking on a file opens up the editing panel below instead of to the right
	Less indentation

		Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten whenever the parent component re-renders. Instead, use a data or computed property based on the prop's value. Prop being mutated: "drawer"
			Appears when u click out of side nav menu gg

Upgrade all python packages to latest version
Remove python packages I am not using

Make sure python changes are reflected in vue
Standardize variable naming scheme (camelCase vs under_scores)
Backend naming (python)
	lowercase_underscore for functions and variables
	UpperCase for classes

Timer bugs 
	Pomodoro timer didn't start immediately from reboot
	Stop timer once post timer is done
Delete all random commented code

Frontend naming (js)
	lowerUpperCase for variables and functions
	replace tabs with 2 spaces

Alarm sounded weird
Doesn't sound sometimes if not on screen
Doesn't go to long break


Errors I have had:
	Deleting files sometimes doesn't work
	Glitched out when submitting form after ending timer data?

	Make add file draggable to a location
		May not be necessary if open file on double click works as well as I hope


Make sure migration works:
	check if "onclick not a function" errors are still present
	Make sure pomodoro works
	Make sure mobile version works
		And that no errors were created while I made mobile and laptop be different
	Check if I get any console errors in general
	Make sure I didn't mess anything up with function renaming

Version 3 Changes (in Progress)
Ideally, finish everything in here by start of March
Be done with this by April 1st

------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Change file structure
		Allow custom sorting of items
		Add tags
		Sorting options
			Manual
			By name
			By due date

	An archive option / mark off (in content section)
		Keeps file, but doesn't show it
		Allows time tracked data to persist and be attached to a file

	Todo date
		Date and time selector
		Calendar that shows todos by date

	A useful left banner, with file shortcuts
		Powerful search function
		Frequently used / most used
		Most recently used
		Top level file names

	Add limits to lengths, so things don't go way off screen
		Allow timer data to be deleted/modified from time data view
		Limit path depth at 5
			Remove from the start of the list (top level)
		Limit path length to some amount of characters
		Limit tracked title to some amount of characters

	An undo button for most actions
		Eventually could have a list of all changes ever, like in TickTick

	Data visualization for usage
		Show time tracked data and completed file data
		Very customizable outputs

	Publicize the app more
		Reddit/vue
		ShowHN
		Reach out to vuetify to see if they want to showcase it
		Reddit/productivity
		Reddit/time tracking
		Show friends
		Mostly ask for honest feedback, and for how to make the app better

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4 Changes (Future)
Get all features added by end of spring semester, May 15th
Product should be fully functional by then

------------------------------------------------------------------------


	Add tiptap for content editing
		Make it so the note taking aspect can be more serious
		Maybe an expand left option on the content editing

	See how it functions at scale on digital ocean

	Optimzations for snappy preformance even with many items

	Multiple item select
		Possible uses: drag, delete, date

	View user data
		Get user analytics, likely through logs stored
		How often are they on
		How many tasks do they have

	Add notifications, especially for phones

	Preventative measures
		Don't allow users to have more than 500 tasks


	Things to consider
		Maybe keep Time logs open on switching files, instead of changing to file info every time new file is selected?
		Update headers to say which font to use in nginx
		Write tests
		Maybe use hashed data instead of increasing numbers for file numbers
			Harder to predict user numbers and gives less exploitable data
			Also makes it much harder to keep track of user info
		See how people like current font size, I use app on 110% scaling
		Make content section hover at top of screen in case user tree goes really far down
		Default src : self in csp header makes something not work on production server, but right now it seems to have no effect on the website
			See if it actually is messing with something, and how to fix that if I have to
		jwt user authentication, not just token based
		Data extraction in json form
			Likely as text file (or whatever form json uses)
			Both todos and time data
		Allow dragging to be subfile even if the file is closed
		Add a pausing feature to timers (if users seem to want it)
			Pausing in general makes the app more difficult
			Will need to keep track of total paused time
			And for current pause period, I will need to
			Keep track of start time, until when it ends
			But if the user is pausing
			They should probably be stopping the timer
			Unless they are using them in a completely different way than I envisioned
			Which is kinda the point
			I think I can add a pausing feature later
		Allow longer duration of timers, especially for intervals?
		Eventually allow multiple timers, possible as a dropdown menu of timers
		When timer is running show it up top, in the browser tab?
		Allow user to quickly check the current pre timer note in drop down?
		Make button flip in menu for timer
		Timezone changes?
		Handle network timeouts and the fallacies of distributed computing
		Break up totrno component into subcomponents
		Eventually password reset and email verification
		Adds some comments to js code
		24 hours vs 12 hour option for calendar / todo view
		Repeat renders should be done in list (buttons in contact me)
		Allow user to disable or enable any of the pre, post and next timer notes
		Range options (start of range be current time, end of range be  current time, certain amount of time ahead??)
		And allow user to decide after 4 breaks to continue to next break
		Add functionality for timer to go ahead or not automatically (between pomodoro timers)
		Error message if notes are longer than 300 characters
		Use clock for set time in pomodoro choosing?
		More tooltips on hovering over things?
		Change some dialog formatting to be done better in totrno (?)
			So dialog is not being shown using v-if, instead use a button, how it is supposed to be
		Handle extreme cases
			Limit depth
				Esp on mobile
			Limit path up top
			Limit file name lenght
				Especially up top in path and in timer data
		Fix mobile problems
			Text starts off indented pretty far, can move it left more
		Path traversal in path bar stops when first item with matching title is reached
			If two items are named "asdf" the one deeper will always be stopped at first
			Traverse by key, basically
		Generally better formatting on mobile
			Pomodoro timer goes off screen
		Don't allow changing timer types until current timer is stopped
		Make account page / timer selection look nicer depending on laptop vs phone
		Lower amount of code
			Use v-for for about page and account page
			Make sure all functions are required
		Standardize quotes in function calls, and function calls in general ('' on outside, "" on inside, always in js)
		Update pictures in about page, as I keep adding features
		More advanced countdown and pomodoro time data 
			Allow seconds and minutes
